## What is binsync

Binsync enables manual and automated synchronization of the following reverse engineering artifacts between IDA Pro, Binary Ninja, and angr management running on the same machine or different machines:

- Function names
- Comments
- Names of stack variables
- Types of stack variables (warning!)
- User-defined structs

All data is stored in a human-friendly text format (toml) inside a Git repo.

For now, go check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/angr/binsync/wiki).
